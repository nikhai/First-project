				<h3>SAFETY</h3>
				<h4>Option for a safer and more relaxed driving</h4>
				<p>If the maps are outdated, your navigation system may frequently provide you with improper instructions. Updated navigation helps safe driving by preparing for unexpected situations arising from changes in the road network. Anyone can encounter annoying mistakes in route planning that are often thought to be the fault of the navigation system. Actually, the most common reason for errors in route calculation is due to the outdated maps.

				<h3>$ TIME & COST EFFICIENCY</h3>
				<h4>Optimized travel time & fuel consumption</h4>
				<p>By using updated maps the system saves you time by optimal route planning. You may also reduce the average fuel consumption of your vehicle by up to 12 per cent.</p>

				<div class="col-3-div">
				<h3>CONVENIENCE</h3>
				<h4>Comfort & efficiency by POI</h4>

			<p style="background: orange">We're both adults. I can't pretend I don't know that person is you. I want there to be no confusion. I know I owe you my life. And more than that, I respect the strategy. In your position, I would have done the same. One issue, which troubles me, I don't know what happens when our three-month contract ends. You know why I do this. I want security for my family. 

			No speeches. Short speech. You lost your partner today. What's his name - Emilio? Emilio is going to prison. The DEA took all your money, your lab. You got nothing. Square one. But you know the business and I know the chemistry. I'm thinking... maybe you and I could partner up. </p>
			<p style="background: orange">I'm sorry, what were you asking me? Oh, yes, that stupid plastic container I asked you to buy. You see, hydrofluoric acid won't eat through plastic. It will, however, dissolve metal, rock, glass, ceramic. So there's that. How about something with some protein, maybe? Something green, huh? How are you even alive? 

			That is seventeen five - your half of the thirty-five thousand. Plus there's an extra fifteen in there, it's all yours, you've earned it. We made a deal. That's right. Because I think that we can do business together - we came to an understanding. Take a look at the money in your hand. Now just imagine making that every week. That's right. Two pounds a week, thirty-five thousand a pound. </p>
